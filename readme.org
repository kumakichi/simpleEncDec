* About

  a demo program to encrypt user data which will be uploaded onto skydrive

* More words

  in order to make the encrypt/decrypt progress faster, i just use xor here, should be replaced with RC4, AES, etc. 

  also, the default encrypt size is 1MB, not the whole file, this is not safe

* How to use

  quite simple

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $ file testElf 
    testElf: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
    $ ./simpleEncDec -b 0x33 testElf 
    2015/05/14 20:54:36 51 1048576
    2015/05/14 20:54:36 Successfully enc/dec, remember the sign is : 0x33
    $ file testElf 
    testElf: data
    $ ./simpleEncDec -b 0x33 testElf 
    2015/05/14 20:54:42 51 1048576
    2015/05/14 20:54:42 Successfully enc/dec, remember the sign is : 0x33
    $ file testElf 
    testElf: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped  
  #+END_SRC
